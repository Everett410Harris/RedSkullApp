# RedSkullApp

This web application is an ASP.NET Core application w/ SQL Server Database(DB) & CRUD operations. This application for a business I am apart of, with a fellow veteran. The idea is to allow users to build their own personal computers from the ground up. We offer various components and a wide variety of parts. This application will highlight a few of those items, along with the ability to place an order, store customer info, and a budget conversion, to allow users to stay within their budget. This will be a work in progress over the next few weeks! Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions.
